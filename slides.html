The colors are vibrant, the sky is painted with shades of pink and orange, and it looks almost too good to be true. You’re ready to share it, maybe even plan a visit… but wait! Is that photo real, or was it generated by AI? Welcome to Can you trust your eyes, a challenge that will test your ability to tell fact from fiction in an age where images can be generated by AI with just a few clicks. AI tools have gotten so good that even experts are sometimes fooled, and it’s easier than ever to create fake images that look completely real. But why does it matter?",
      "THE AI REVOLUTION: In a world full of AI-generated content, knowing what’s real and what’s not is more important than ever. Think of all the ways these images can be used: to spread misinformation, create viral hoaxes, or even manipulate opinions. This game will put your skills to the test, sharpening your eye for detail and helping you learn what to look for when spotting AI-generated images.",
      "HOW TO PLAY?: In each round, you’ll be shown an image. Your job? Simply decide: Is this a real photograph, or was it created by AI? Each image might look convincing, but look closely—there may be clues hiding in plain sight."
